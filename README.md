# HomeBridge Alarm.com Plugin

Alarm.com plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) using the [node-alarm-dot-com](https://github.com/mkormendy/node-alarm-dot-com) interface.

Based purely off of John Hurliman's FrontPoint* plugin for Homebridge<small>[â†—](https://github.com/jhurliman/homebridge-frontpoint)</small> with modifications to the namespace and branding as Alarm.com instead.

> **NOTE:** Because this uses Node.js-based HTTP requests to communicate with Alarm.com directly, this plugin does not require any additional accounts with access to external proxy APIs (e.g., WrapAPI). ðŸŽ‰

<small>*FrontPoint is simply a rebranded service provider for Alarm.com, but FrontPoint is not needed for this plugin to work.</small>
