# HomeBridge Alarm.com Plugin

Alarm.com plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

Based purely off of John Hurliman's FrontPoint* plugin for Homebridge<small>[â†—](https://github.com/jhurliman/homebridge-frontpoint)</small> with modifications to the namespace and nomenclature as Alarm.com-branded instead.

> **PRO:** This plugin does not require any additional access to external proxy APIs (e.g., WrapAPI), instead it uses Node.js to interact with Alarm.com directly.

<small>*FrontPoint is simply a rebranded service provider for Alarm.com, but FrontPoint is not needed for this plugin to work.</small>
