# Alarm.com plugin for Homebridge using Node.js

Alarm.com plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) using the [node-alarm-dot-com](https://github.com/mkormendy/node-alarm-dot-com) interface.

Forked from John Hurliman's FrontPoint* plugin for Homebridge<small>[â†—](https://github.com/jhurliman/homebridge-frontpoint)</small> to replace the branding and code namespace from FrontPoint to Alarm.com.

> **NOTE:** Because this implementation uses Node.js-based HTTP requests to communicate with Alarm.com directly, this plugin does not require accounts or access with WrapAPI. ðŸŽ‰

<small>*FrontPoint is simply a rebranded service provider for Alarm.com, but FrontPoint is not needed for this plugin to work.</small>

# Troubleshooting

If you are replacing the Bryan Bartow's Homebridge plugin with this implementation, you may be required to delete the `~/.homebridge/accessories/cachedAccessories` file for the new platform to show up with the new panel, accessories and devices.

**WARNING:** If you delete the contents of the `~/.homebridge/persist` folder, your Homebridge and devices will become unresponsive and you will have to entirely re-pair the Homebridge bridge (remove and re-scan the QR-code for Homebridge and set up all of your accessories/devices again).
